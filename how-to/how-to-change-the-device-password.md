**The Bluetooth lock and mobile phone does not save the device password. Please be sure to store the password and the RFID guarantee card properly.** Please avoid using easy-to-guess passwords such as 0000-0000-0000-0000 to prevent unauthorized usage of the lock. If you use AUTO-PASSWORD to get random passwords, you can take a screenshot or copy the passwords in your wallet or store them in a cloud storage such as iCloud or Google Drive.
